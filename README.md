- 👋 Hi, I’m @PauKiLeong
- 👀 I’m Malaysian and currently employed in Singapore
- 🌱 I’m picking up programming knowledge and skills to become a full time software engineer! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some Python open source projects, so let me know if you need a hand. However I might need guidance since I'm still a newbie in software development :)
